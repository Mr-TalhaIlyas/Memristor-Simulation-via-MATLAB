# Simulation of Memristors using MATLAB

In this repo I simulate the effect of 4th basic circuit element called "Memristor" using the mathematical equations provided in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8118008).

## Introduction
In 1971, Leon Chua hypothesized the fourth fundamental circuit component while attempting to build up a missing constitutive relationship between the electrical charge and the
magnetic flux to complete the symmetry. Chua named this speculative nonlinear gadget, memristor (memory + resistor) since it showed the hysteresis property of the-then
ferromagnetic center memory furthermore the dissipative qualities of a resistor. Plainly, in such gadgets, the nonlinear resistance can be remembered inconclusively by controlling the stream of the electrical charge or the magnetic flux. The memristor was proposed to have a memresistance, M and a function defined as dM=Mdq.

## Memristance

Memristance is a property of the memristor. If charge flows in one direction through a circuit, the resistance of that
component of the circuit will increase, and if charge flows in the opposite direction, the resistance will decrease. If the flow
of charge is stopped by turning off the applied voltage, the component will ‘remember’ the last resistance that it had, and
when the flow of charge starts again, the resistance of the circuit will be what it was when it was last active.

## Modes of Memristor

Memristor operates in two modes Linear and Non-Linear.

You can get details [here](https://www.theregister.com/Print/2011/12/27/memristors_and_mouttet/)
I have also put some basic papers regarding memristor [here](https://github.com/Mr-TalhaIlyas/Memristor-Simulation-via-MATLAB/tree/master/docs)
